---> This is the reference image for the project.
---> And with the help of the given .py file you can have a clear idea about the project...
#Here are some of the most important points to be noted:
1. Install the turtle library to your IDE and then futher move for next.
2. Then import the turtle library as it is needed for the background and import random too as the computer will decide some random location for the points or 
leaf in this case.
example code:
      __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
     import turtle as t    
     import random as rd    
     _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
      
#Here the t and rd are random constant for indecating value for the imported library!
3. Now start designing the codes as per user requirement, designing such as the body, color, dimensions, etc:-
4. Now define the boundary for the codes.
example code:
      ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
      def outside_window():
      ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
